#Title: Validating User Forms Lab

###Type:
- Lab

###Summary
Create client side form validation with jQuery

###Estimated Time:
- 2-3 hours or homework

###Prerequisites:
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery selectors & events
- Regex

###Objectives:
* The goal of this assignment is to get used to the jQuery syntax and practice using it to manipulate the DOM

### To do:
* Write jQuery to store the appropriate items you will be selecting from the DOM into variables for easy usage.
* Write code to initially hide the errors. Check the HTML to see how to select all the items that are error messages.
* Write jQuery to get values from user inputs
* Write the validateName() function
* Write the validateAge(), validatePhone(), and validateEmail() functions
  * Don't worry if you don't totally understand the Regular Expression code. All of the regular expressions you need have already been provided to you.
* Display the information submitted if everything validates
* Add clear functionality to get rid of what is being displayed

### Instructor Notes:
* For starter code, consider giving students just the HTML & CSS or have them build it from scratch. Having starter code helps isolate practicing the JS, but forces an architecture onto the students which they sometime struggle with.

###Post-mortem:
- What worked?
- Student misunderstandings?
